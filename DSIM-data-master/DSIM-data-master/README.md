DSIM-data
=========

Data from Diabetic Simulator
The glucose-insulin simulation model developed by Dalla-Man et al. [1] is used to construct a simulated dataset. We generated one day of data for 10 patients by randomly selecting patient parameters within realistic ranges. Parameters and their ranges are given below:
i) body weight: 50kg-120kg
ii) meal amount: 30,000 mg- 100,000mg
iii) insulin dose: 2U-10U
iv) basal Glucose: 120mg/dl - 200mg/dl
v)basal Glucose production: 1.08mg/kg/min - 8.08 mg/kg/min

Data was recorded at every minute, yielding 1440 time points for 16 variables.




Data folder organization:

1)All data are stored in "DSIM_data" folder.

2) "actual_data" contains the actual data for 10 patients of DSIM dataset. 

3) "missing_data" contains all simulated missing values of actual data. Missing values are simulated for 5%-50% missing ratios with a step size of 5%.

4) "full_row_missing" contains simulated missing data where all variables in a row is missing. 

5) "imputed_data" contains all the imputed files generated by our method. It has a subfolder called "full_row_missing_impute" which contains imputed files for full_row_missing files.
